		<p>
			I'm a Software Engineer with 3+ years of professional experience building backend systems and full-stack applications. My work emphasizes performance, system reliability, and clean engineering, with core expertise in Go, Python, microservices, distributed systems, and real-time data flows.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4">
			Over the years, I’ve contributed to projects across cybersecurity, cloud, analytics, and digital products—often owning both implementation and architectural design. I enjoy turning complex requirements into clean, maintainable services and working across the stack when it leads to a better product.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4">
			Beyond day-to-day engineering, I’m driven by curiosity, continual learning, and creating software that feels purposeful. My goal is always to deliver solutions that are both technically solid and genuinely valuable to the people who use them.

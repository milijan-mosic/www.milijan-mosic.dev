# Advices

You’re not selling code — you’re selling solutions

You must translate tech into value

Do not start with tech — start with a niche + a problem

If you build something and nobody knows it exists → it’s useless

Learn minimal sales + marketing:

- talking to customers
- writing clear landing pages
- validating ideas before coding
- making offers people want

# Strategy

Stage 1: Freelance / Consulting (quick cash + learning customers/market)
Stage 2: Productized Service (consistent income)
Stage 3: SaaS / Micro-product (build only after customer validation)

Markets where software has high ROI:

- logistics
- manufacturing
- delivery systems
- medical scheduling
- real estate workflow tools
- internal dashboards
- automation for e-commerce
- fleet routing

# The Execution Model (how to start)

## Step 1 — Find a pain

Talk to real businesses:

- “What software do you hate?”
- “What tasks waste the most man-hours?”
- “What requires manual spreadsheets?”
- “Where do errors cost money?”

## Step 2 — Quantify the value

If you save them €3k/month and charge €1k/month → they say “Yes.”

## Step 3 — Build minimal solution

Not a perfect app.
Just something that solves the pain.

## Step 4 — Understand buying decision

You sell to management, not engineers.

# Pricing Strategy

1. NEVER charge per hour.

Hourly pricing:

- punishes you for being productive
- races you to the bottom

2. Charge per project or outcome.
3. Recurring revenue (maintenance) is gold.

# Avoid This Mistake (99% of engineers fail here)

- Building a full SaaS before you know anyone will buy it.
- Spending months on backend architecture.
- Thinking “good product sells itself.”

# How to get first clients (realistically)

- LinkedIn outreach (personalized)
- Talk to local businesses
- Join industry slack/discord communities
- Offer a free strategy session
- Present yourself as business problem solver, not coder

# Ultimate Power Move (that gives you stable business)

Become the “go-to” person for one niche.

- “Automation guy for warehouses”
- “Internal dashboards for medical clinics”
- “Routing solutions for delivery companies”
- “Operational software for repair centers”
- “Geospatial routing optimization for fleets”

Brief description — what the project is, what problem it solves or what features it has

Technologies used / tech stack — list of languages/frameworks/tools (e.g. Go, React, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)

Role / what you personally did (optional but good) — e.g. “backend + API design + deployment config”, “full-stack + frontend + DB”, etc.

Visual (screenshot / image / short GIF / link) — ideally a screenshot of the interface, architecture diagram, UI mockup, or anything visual. Visuals help clients judge quality quickly.

Outcome / metrics (if possible) — e.g. “reduced latency by 40%”, “served 5k active users”, “improved reliability”, “deployed to production”, whatever is meaningful.
```
